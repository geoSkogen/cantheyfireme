        <div class="modalText">
          <div class="toggleTextP">Our goal is to have a positive and productive workplace where staff and customers alike feel comfortable.
          Approaching fellow staff in the workplace regarding activities, organizations, or causes, regardless of
          how worthwhile, important, or benevolent, can sometimes create unnecessary apprehension and pressures for
          fellow staff. In order to prevent disruption of our daily operations and to help ensure we maintain an upbeat
          and productive working environment, we have established the following rules around the solicitation of
          individuals and the distribution of materials on company property.
          </div>
          <h4>What does "solicitation" mean?</h4>
          <div class="toggleTextP">For purposes of this policy, “solicitation” means activity that prompts an immediate
           response from the staff being solicited; it is more than having a conversation with a co-worker, rather
           it is activity that is intended to get someone to do something (for example, sign a petition, buy a ticket
           to an event, or donate to a cause).

        <h3>Social Media Policy</h3>
        <div class="modalText">
          <div class="textP">This policy applies to all staff for job-related
           social media use, for personal, off-work hours, and non-work-related use.
           We encourage staff to speak up and join the conversation while following this
           policy. We have a lot of creative staff at New Seasons Market who may choose
           to express themselves through their own personal social media posts. We respect
           your right to choose to do this on your own time. Sometimes problems can arise
           when a personal post appears to be associated with New Seasons Market, or when
           a personal post is used in ways that violate the rights of others.
           <br/><br/>
           Our social media outlets are an extension of the sales floor, so we ask that
           you not say anything online that you wouldn’t say to our customers in person.
           Social media outlets are great places for positive, helpful interactions. If
           you have grievances about your job, your coworkers, or company policy, it’s
           appropriate to address them directly with your store manager or a member of HR.
           Be honest, and always consider the possible outcomes of the comments that you make.
           <br/><br/>
           In order to ensure that we avoid any misunderstandings or other problems,
            <span class="emph">the following rules apply to social media use.
             Violation of these rules may result in corrective action
             and/or termination of employment, as well as legal action, when appropriate:
